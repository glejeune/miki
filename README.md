# miki

**miki** is a small wiki with small features :

* We do not track pages' changes.
* We do not store user informations on pages.
* Every user is admin -- because sharing is a question of confidence.
* Each page is formated using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) -- no more, no less.
* We do not support attachment, images, ... Except if you use them from external links.
* There is no database, each page is store in a file on the server.
* **But** we have a REST API \o/
